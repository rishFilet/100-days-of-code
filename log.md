# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing react in a real world application. Completed a donate Call to Action button with colour animation and confetti using react-dom-confetti

**Thoughts** First time using react and it is very similar to dart, easy to pick up but can be seen hard to master.

### Day 2: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-started flutter/dart and created a home screen with active buttons and retrieving an image using api

**Thoughts** After leaving flutter for almost a year, i found it alot easier to pick back up given that i understand programming concepts a lot better and able to translate the code and what it is doing. An example is seeing how constructors/intiailisers work. It is easier to figure out the code and cleaner architecture having this experience. This means that the more i practice concpets as opposed to specific syntax, i can learn any language or stack pretty quickly.

### Day 3: September 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fixing the animation for the donate button on TTM website. Fixed layout issues with text, button and heart. Made heart grow with hover over button.

**Thoughts** Animations are very tough in web dev. I have a new respect for how much effort goes into making an animation for a webpage now.
