# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing react in a real world application. Completed a donate Call to Action button with colour animation and confetti using react-dom-confetti

**Thoughts** First time using react and it is very similar to dart, easy to pick up but can be seen hard to master.
